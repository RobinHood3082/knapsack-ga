Multiple Constraint Knapsack Solver using Genetic Algorithm

This is an application of Genetic Algorithm to solve 0-1 Knapsack Problems with multiple contraints.

This can be a decision making tool, that can decide the (approximately) most optimal choice among a set of choices, each with different contraints and each constraints having a limit.

Practically, this can be used in business where each decision might have some constraints or resource limits to execute, and the most optimal decision is required.
